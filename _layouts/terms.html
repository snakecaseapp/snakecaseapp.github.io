        <p class="mt-6">This Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement is relevant to any individual located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) who uses the Services. Applicable law, including the European Union Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“GDPR”), may require Snake Case to provide additional and different information about its data processing practices to data subjects in the EEA. If you are accessing the Services from a member state of the EEA through a site targeting an EEA member country, then this Supplemental GDPR Privacy Statement applies to you.</p>
        <p class="mt-6">For purposes of the GDPR and other applicable laws, we, Snake Case SL, with offices at Calle Edgar Neville nº30 3ºB 28010 Madrid Spain, are the data controller of your personal information that we collect. Where the processing of personal information is undertaken by our affiliates, subsidiaries, or related entities, they are a joint controller with Snake Case. Where you provide us with the personal information of third parties for processing, such as your customers, then you are the data controller of that information and we act as a processor of such data.</p>
        <p class="mt-6">Legal Basis of Processing. In general, the legal basis for Snake Case’s processing of your personal data in connection with the Services is Article 6(1)(b) of the EU GDPR, which allows the processing of personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access, use, or register for our Services, you form a contract with us based on the applicable terms of service, and Snake Case needs to process your personal data to provide the requested Services. As exceptions, Snake Case relies on your consent to this policy with respect to cookies that are not strictly necessary and direct marketing emails per Article 6(1)(a) of the EU GDPR, and pursues legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) of the EU GDPR with respect to situations where Snake Case needs to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws or processes your personal data to improve our business and Services.</p>
        <p class="mt-6">Personal Data Transfers outside of the EEA. Snake Case may transmit some of your personal data to a country where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction, including the United States.
